## The `max_connections` parameter in MySQL controls the **maximum number of simultaneous client connections** that the MySQL server will allow.
    It is not determined per user or per query; instead, it sets a global limit on the total number of active connections allowed at any given time.

### How `max_connections` Works:
- **Global Limit**: `max_connections` is a global configuration setting that determines the maximum number of concurrent client connections that the MySQL server will allow. Once the total number of active connections reaches this limit, no new connections can be made until some of the existing connections are closed or time out.
  
- **Not Per User**: This limit is applied to **all** users and connections combined, not individually per user. That means if there are multiple users or applications connecting to the server, the total number of active connections from all users cannot exceed this global limit.
  
- **Not Per Query**: It is also not per query. A connection to the server is established when a client (user, application, or process) sends a request to MySQL, and that connection remains open until the query is finished and the client disconnects. Multiple queries can be executed within a single connection.

### Default Value:
By default, the `max_connections` value is often set to 151 in MySQL. This means that the MySQL server can handle 151 concurrent connections at any given time (including all users and applications connecting).

### Example:
Letâ€™s say `max_connections = 200`. This means the server will allow up to 200 simultaneous connections from all users combined. If one client application opens 3 connections, that will count as 3 of the 200 connections. If there are 50 clients connected, consuming 1 connection each, 150 connections would be left for other clients.

### What Happens When the Limit is Reached:
When the `max_connections` limit is reached, any new connection requests will be rejected with an error like:
```
ERROR 1040 (08004): Too many connections
```

However, you can control this behavior by configuring certain settings to prevent the system from running into issues:

- **Wait Timeout (`wait_timeout` and `interactive_timeout`)**: These parameters determine how long MySQL will wait for a query to be executed before closing an idle connection. If a connection exceeds the timeout, it will be closed, freeing up space for new connections.

- **Connection Pooling**: To manage connections more efficiently, applications often use **connection pooling**. This allows multiple queries to reuse the same connection, minimizing the number of new connections and reducing the overall load on the server.

### How to Change `max_connections`:
You can modify the `max_connections` value in MySQL by updating the MySQL configuration file (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`) or dynamically using a query.

- **To Set Permanently (via `my.cnf` or `my.ini`)**:
  Open your MySQL configuration file and add or modify the `max_connections` directive:

  ```ini
  [mysqld]
  max_connections = 200
  ```

  Then restart the MySQL service to apply the change.

- **To Set Temporarily (via SQL Query)**:
  You can also change the value dynamically without restarting MySQL by running the following query:

  ```sql
  SET GLOBAL max_connections = 200;
  ```

  This change will take effect immediately but will be lost after the MySQL server is restarted. To make it permanent, you must modify the configuration file as well.

### Connection Handling Based on Users:
If you want to restrict the number of connections based on specific users, MySQL provides a different mechanism. You can set connection limits for each user separately using the `max_user_connections` parameter. For example, to limit a particular user to 10 concurrent connections, you can execute the following command:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'user'@'hostname' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 10;
```

This will limit the number of concurrent connections for the specified user but still respect the global `max_connections` setting.

### Summary:
- `max_connections` is a **global** setting and controls the **total number of connections** that can be open to the MySQL server at any time. It is not set per user or per query.
- It is not dependent on the number of queries; rather, it's based on the number of simultaneous client connections to the server.
- If the limit is exceeded, new connection requests will be rejected until there are available slots.
- You can configure `max_connections` in the configuration file for persistence or dynamically via SQL for temporary changes.
- For user-specific connection limits, use `max_user_connections` to restrict the number of concurrent connections per user.
