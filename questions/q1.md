### Q7. Analyze the performance of a specific query

How can you analyze the performance of a specific query in MySQL?

Choose the correct answer from below:

- **Use SHOW VARIABLES**
- **Use ANALYZE FORMAT=JSON**
- **Use GRANT command**
- **Use CREATE INDEX**

---

#### Correct Answer:
**Use ANALYZE FORMAT=JSON**

#### Explanation:
- **ANALYZE FORMAT=JSON**: This command is used to analyze a query's execution plan in MySQL, providing detailed insights into how the query is being processed. It helps in understanding performance bottlenecks and optimizing the query.

The other options are incorrect:
- **SHOW VARIABLES**: This command shows system variables and their current values but does not analyze the performance of a specific query.
- **GRANT command**: This is used for managing user privileges, not for query performance analysis.
- **CREATE INDEX**: While indexes can improve query performance, this command is not used for analyzing query performance directly. It is used to create indexes on tables.
