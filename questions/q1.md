## Q1. Analyze the performance of a specific query

How can you analyze the performance of a specific query in MySQL?

Choose the correct answer from below:

- **A**: Use SHOW VARIABLES
- **B**: Use ANALYZE FORMAT=JSON
- **C**: Use GRANT command
- **D**: Use CREATE INDEX

### Correct Answer:
**B**: Use ANALYZE FORMAT=JSON

#### Explanation:
- **ANALYZE FORMAT=JSON**: This command is used to analyze a query's execution plan in MySQL, providing detailed insights into how the query is being processed. It helps in understanding performance bottlenecks and optimizing the query.

The other options are incorrect:
- **A**: SHOW VARIABLES - This command shows system variables and their current values but does not analyze the performance of a specific query.
- **C**: GRANT command - This is used for managing user privileges, not for query performance analysis.
- **D**: CREATE INDEX - While indexes can improve query performance, this command is not used for analyzing query performance directly. It is used to create indexes on tables.
