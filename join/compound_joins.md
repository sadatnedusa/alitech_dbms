### **Understanding Compound Joins**

**Compound Joins** involve using multiple columns or conditions to match rows between two tables. Unlike simple joins (where you match on a single column), compound joins use multiple columns to establish the relationship between tables.

---

### **When to Use Compound Joins**
Compound joins are useful when:
1. **Data Matching Requires Multiple Keys**: The relationship between two tables depends on multiple columns.
2. **Avoiding Ambiguities**: Ensures uniqueness and avoids incorrect matches.
3. **Complex Relationships**: When business logic requires matching rows based on several conditions.

### **Example Scenarios for Compound Joins**

#### **1. Matching Orders and Shipments**
**Scenario**: An e-commerce system tracks orders and shipments. Each order has a unique combination of `OrderID` and `ProductID`. You need to match orders with their respective shipments.

**Orders Table**:
| **OrderID** | **ProductID** | **Quantity** |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1           | 101           | 2            |
| 1           | 102           | 1            |
| 2           | 101           | 4            |

**Shipments Table**:
| **OrderID** | **ProductID** | **ShipmentDate** |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| 1           | 101           | 2024-11-01       |
| 1           | 102           | 2024-11-02       |
| 2           | 101           | 2024-11-03       |

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    O.OrderID,
    O.ProductID,
    O.Quantity,
    S.ShipmentDate
FROM Orders O
JOIN Shipments S
ON O.OrderID = S.OrderID
   AND O.ProductID = S.ProductID;
```

**Output**:
| **OrderID** | **ProductID** | **Quantity** | **ShipmentDate** |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| 1           | 101           | 2            | 2024-11-01       |
| 1           | 102           | 1            | 2024-11-02       |
| 2           | 101           | 4            | 2024-11-03       |

---

#### **2. Matching Employee Data Across Systems**
**Scenario**: An organization uses multiple systems, and you need to match employee records based on `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `BirthDate`.

**HR System**:
| **FirstName** | **LastName** | **BirthDate** | **Department** |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| Alice         | Smith        | 1990-01-01    | IT             |
| Bob           | Brown        | 1985-02-14    | Finance        |

**Payroll System**:
| **FirstName** | **LastName** | **BirthDate** | **Salary** |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| Alice         | Smith        | 1990-01-01    | 80000      |
| Bob           | Brown        | 1985-02-14    | 90000      |

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    HR.FirstName,
    HR.LastName,
    HR.Department,
    P.Salary
FROM HR_System HR
JOIN Payroll_System P
ON HR.FirstName = P.FirstName
   AND HR.LastName = P.LastName
   AND HR.BirthDate = P.BirthDate;
```

**Output**:
| **FirstName** | **LastName** | **Department** | **Salary** |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| Alice         | Smith        | IT             | 80000      |
| Bob           | Brown        | Finance        | 90000      |

---

#### **3. Identifying Overlapping Date Ranges**
**Scenario**: Two systems track room bookings, and you need to find overlapping bookings.

**Bookings Table A**:
| **RoomID** | **StartDate** | **EndDate** |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1          | 2024-11-01    | 2024-11-05  |
| 2          | 2024-11-02    | 2024-11-04  |

**Bookings Table B**:
| **RoomID** | **StartDate** | **EndDate** |
|------------|---------------|-------------|
| 1          | 2024-11-04    | 2024-11-08  |
| 2          | 2024-11-01    | 2024-11-03  |

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    A.RoomID,
    A.StartDate AS A_StartDate,
    A.EndDate AS A_EndDate,
    B.StartDate AS B_StartDate,
    B.EndDate AS B_EndDate
FROM Bookings_A A
JOIN Bookings_B B
ON A.RoomID = B.RoomID
   AND A.StartDate <= B.EndDate
   AND A.EndDate >= B.StartDate;
```

**Output**:
| **RoomID** | **A_StartDate** | **A_EndDate** | **B_StartDate** | **B_EndDate** |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1          | 2024-11-01      | 2024-11-05    | 2024-11-04      | 2024-11-08    |
| 2          | 2024-11-02      | 2024-11-04    | 2024-11-01      | 2024-11-03    |

---

#### **4. Merging Sales Data**
**Scenario**: A retail system stores daily sales by store and category. You need to merge data from two tables to get sales comparisons.

**Sales 2023**:
| **StoreID** | **Category** | **Sales** |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1           | Electronics  | 5000      |
| 2           | Groceries    | 7000      |

**Sales 2024**:
| **StoreID** | **Category** | **Sales** |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1           | Electronics  | 5500      |
| 2           | Groceries    | 7500      |

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    S23.StoreID,
    S23.Category,
    S23.Sales AS Sales_2023,
    S24.Sales AS Sales_2024
FROM Sales_2023 S23
JOIN Sales_2024 S24
ON S23.StoreID = S24.StoreID
   AND S23.Category = S24.Category;
```

**Output**:
| **StoreID** | **Category**   | **Sales_2023** | **Sales_2024** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1           | Electronics    | 5000           | 5500           |
| 2           | Groceries      | 7000           | 7500           |

### **Advantages of Compound Joins**
1. **Enhanced Precision**: Matches rows using multiple criteria, reducing ambiguity.
2. **Complex Relationships**: Facilitates multi-column comparisons.
3. **Real-World Relevance**: Handles complex scenarios such as overlapping dates, composite keys, or multidimensional data.

---

### **Additional Learning Resources**
- Practice compound joins on **SQL Playground** tools like [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/) or **LeetCode SQL**.
- Experiment with real-world datasets like **HR databases** or **sales records**.
  
---

Hereâ€™s an **in-depth example** of using compound joins with a realistic dataset from a logistics and supply chain domain.

---

### **Scenario: Logistics Tracking System**
A company manages logistics by storing data in two tables: **Shipments** and **TransportDetails**. Each shipment can have multiple packages, and the transport details must match the shipment's **ShipmentID**, **SourceCity**, and **DestinationCity**.

---

### **Dataset Overview**

#### **1. Shipments Table**
| **ShipmentID** | **SourceCity** | **DestinationCity** | **PackageCount** | **DispatchDate** |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| SH001          | New York       | Los Angeles         | 20               | 2024-11-01       |
| SH002          | Chicago        | Houston             | 15               | 2024-11-02       |
| SH003          | New York       | Miami               | 10               | 2024-11-03       |
| SH004          | San Francisco  | Seattle             | 12               | 2024-11-03       |

#### **2. TransportDetails Table**
| **TransportID** | **ShipmentID** | **SourceCity** | **DestinationCity** | **TruckNumber** | **DriverName**  |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| T001            | SH001          | New York       | Los Angeles         | TRK123          | John Doe        |
| T002            | SH002          | Chicago        | Houston             | TRK456          | Jane Smith      |
| T003            | SH003          | New York       | Miami               | TRK789          | Bob Johnson     |
| T004            | SH001          | New York       | Miami               | TRK987          | Alice White     |
| T005            | SH004          | San Francisco  | Seattle             | TRK654          | Carl Brown      |

---

### **Problem**
We need to retrieve the details of shipments along with their corresponding transport information. The matching must be based on the **ShipmentID**, **SourceCity**, and **DestinationCity**.

---

### **SQL Query**
```sql
SELECT 
    S.ShipmentID,
    S.SourceCity,
    S.DestinationCity,
    S.PackageCount,
    S.DispatchDate,
    T.TransportID,
    T.TruckNumber,
    T.DriverName
FROM Shipments S
JOIN TransportDetails T
ON S.ShipmentID = T.ShipmentID
   AND S.SourceCity = T.SourceCity
   AND S.DestinationCity = T.DestinationCity;
```

---

### **Output**
| **ShipmentID** | **SourceCity** | **DestinationCity** | **PackageCount** | **DispatchDate** | **TransportID** | **TruckNumber** | **DriverName**  |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| SH001          | New York       | Los Angeles         | 20               | 2024-11-01       | T001            | TRK123          | John Doe        |
| SH002          | Chicago        | Houston             | 15               | 2024-11-02       | T002            | TRK456          | Jane Smith      |
| SH003          | New York       | Miami               | 10               | 2024-11-03       | T003            | TRK789          | Bob Johnson     |
| SH004          | San Francisco  | Seattle             | 12               | 2024-11-03       | T005            | TRK654          | Carl Brown      |

---

### **Key Observations**
1. The join ensures that only rows where **ShipmentID**, **SourceCity**, and **DestinationCity** match are included.
2. The mismatched row `T004` (where `ShipmentID = SH001` and `DestinationCity = Miami`) is excluded, as it doesn't align with the **SourceCity-DestinationCity** combination in the `Shipments` table.

---

### **When to Use in Real Life?**
- **Logistics**: To reconcile shipment and transport records.
- **E-commerce**: To match orders across multiple warehouses and shipping locations.
- **Healthcare**: To link patient records across departments using multiple keys like `PatientID`, `DepartmentID`, and `Date`.
- **Banking**: To match transaction details across accounts using `AccountID`, `BranchID`, and `TransactionDate`.

---

### **Complex Extension**
Imagine now you also want to include **audit records** (e.g., package inspection logs). You would perform a **compound join** across three tables.

#### **AuditRecords Table**
| **AuditID** | **ShipmentID** | **SourceCity** | **DestinationCity** | **AuditStatus** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| A001        | SH001          | New York       | Los Angeles         | Passed          |
| A002        | SH003          | New York       | Miami               | Failed          |
| A003        | SH002          | Chicago        | Houston             | Passed          |

---

#### **Extended Query**
```sql
SELECT 
    S.ShipmentID,
    S.SourceCity,
    S.DestinationCity,
    S.PackageCount,
    S.DispatchDate,
    T.TransportID,
    T.TruckNumber,
    T.DriverName,
    A.AuditStatus
FROM Shipments S
JOIN TransportDetails T
ON S.ShipmentID = T.ShipmentID
   AND S.SourceCity = T.SourceCity
   AND S.DestinationCity = T.DestinationCity
JOIN AuditRecords A
ON S.ShipmentID = A.ShipmentID
   AND S.SourceCity = A.SourceCity
   AND S.DestinationCity = A.DestinationCity;
```

#### **Output**
| **ShipmentID** | **SourceCity** | **DestinationCity** | **PackageCount** | **DispatchDate** | **TransportID** | **TruckNumber** | **DriverName**  | **AuditStatus** |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| SH001          | New York       | Los Angeles         | 20               | 2024-11-01       | T001            | TRK123          | John Doe        | Passed          |
| SH002          | Chicago        | Houston             | 15               | 2024-11-02       | T002            | TRK456          | Jane Smith      | Passed          |
| SH003          | New York       | Miami               | 10               | 2024-11-03       | T003            | TRK789          | Bob Johnson     | Failed          |

---

Let's extend this example further, breaking down more complex scenarios and how they might relate to **compound joins** in real-world projects. I'll also provide diagrams to help visualize the structure.

### **Extended Example: Logistics and Tracking System**

Let's say that in addition to the **Shipments**, **TransportDetails**, and **AuditRecords** tables, we also have the **CustomerOrders** table, which links customer orders to shipments. This will help in building a more complete picture of how data might be queried in a logistics and supply chain system.

#### **4. CustomerOrders Table**

| **OrderID** | **CustomerID** | **ShipmentID** | **OrderAmount** | **OrderDate** |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| C001        | C123           | SH001          | 1500            | 2024-10-30   |
| C002        | C124           | SH002          | 800             | 2024-11-01   |
| C003        | C125           | SH003          | 1200            | 2024-10-29   |
| C004        | C126           | SH004          | 1000            | 2024-10-31   |

---

### **Use Case: Complex Query Combining Multiple Tables**

Now, you want to retrieve all the data regarding **shipments**, **transportation details**, **audit statuses**, and **customer orders**â€”all linked by the **ShipmentID**, **SourceCity**, and **DestinationCity**. This will be a **compound join** across **four** tables.

#### **SQL Query with Compound Joins**

```sql
SELECT 
    S.ShipmentID,
    S.SourceCity,
    S.DestinationCity,
    S.PackageCount,
    S.DispatchDate,
    T.TransportID,
    T.TruckNumber,
    T.DriverName,
    A.AuditStatus,
    C.CustomerID,
    C.OrderAmount,
    C.OrderDate
FROM Shipments S
JOIN TransportDetails T
    ON S.ShipmentID = T.ShipmentID
    AND S.SourceCity = T.SourceCity
    AND S.DestinationCity = T.DestinationCity
JOIN AuditRecords A
    ON S.ShipmentID = A.ShipmentID
    AND S.SourceCity = A.SourceCity
    AND S.DestinationCity = A.DestinationCity
JOIN CustomerOrders C
    ON S.ShipmentID = C.ShipmentID
    AND S.SourceCity = C.SourceCity
    AND S.DestinationCity = C.DestinationCity;
```

---

#### **Resulting Output:**

| **ShipmentID** | **SourceCity** | **DestinationCity** | **PackageCount** | **DispatchDate** | **TransportID** | **TruckNumber** | **DriverName**  | **AuditStatus** | **CustomerID** | **OrderAmount** | **OrderDate** |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| SH001          | New York       | Los Angeles         | 20               | 2024-11-01       | T001            | TRK123          | John Doe        | Passed          | C123           | 1500            | 2024-10-30   |
| SH002          | Chicago        | Houston             | 15               | 2024-11-02       | T002            | TRK456          | Jane Smith      | Passed          | C124           | 800             | 2024-11-01   |
| SH003          | New York       | Miami               | 10               | 2024-11-03       | T003            | TRK789          | Bob Johnson     | Failed          | C125           | 1200            | 2024-10-29   |
| SH004          | San Francisco  | Seattle             | 12               | 2024-11-03       | T005            | TRK654          | Carl Brown      | Passed          | C126           | 1000            | 2024-10-31   |

---

### **Real-Life Application and Use Case**
This complex query would be extremely useful in scenarios where the logistics team needs to:

- **Track shipments**: They can see the transport details, audit status, and customer orders that are linked to each shipment.
- **Audit and report**: You can check the status of each shipment and determine if there were any issues during the transit, using the `AuditStatus` from the **AuditRecords** table.
- **Financial data**: The `OrderAmount` and `OrderDate` can be used for financial analysis and reporting, allowing the business to see which customer orders are linked to specific shipments.

---

### **Diagram to Visualize the Compound Join**

Hereâ€™s a high-level diagram showing how the **tables** are related via **compound joins** based on **ShipmentID**, **SourceCity**, and **DestinationCity**:

```
+-----------------+       +-------------------+      +--------------------+      +------------------+
|  Shipments      |<------|  TransportDetails  |<---->|   AuditRecords     |<---->|   CustomerOrders |
+-----------------+       +-------------------+      +--------------------+      +------------------+
| ShipmentID      |  +----| ShipmentID         |  +---| ShipmentID          |  +---| ShipmentID       |
| SourceCity      |  |    | SourceCity         |  |   | SourceCity          |  |   | SourceCity       |
| DestinationCity |  |    | DestinationCity    |  |   | DestinationCity     |  |   | DestinationCity  |
| PackageCount    |  |    | TransportID        |  |   | AuditStatus         |  |   | CustomerID       |
| DispatchDate    |  |    | TruckNumber        |  |   |                    |  |   | OrderAmount      |
+-----------------+  |    | DriverName         |  |   |                    |  |   | OrderDate        |
                     |    +-------------------+  |   +--------------------+  |   +------------------+
                     +-------------------------+    +--------------------+  |
                                                 (All tables are linked based on ShipmentID, SourceCity, and DestinationCity)
```


### **When is This Approach Useful in Real Life?**

1. **Supply Chain Management**: When you need to track orders across different departments and integrate shipment details with customer orders, audits, and transportation logs.
   
2. **Inventory Management**: This structure can help match inventory updates (shipment details) with sales orders and track customer demand.
   
3. **E-commerce**: By linking orders, shipments, and transport details, this is useful in a multi-channel supply chain environment where items are being shipped from warehouses to customers.

4. **Health Logistics**: If shipments contain medical supplies or drugs, you could link tracking information with audits (e.g., inspections) and customer (hospital) orders.

### **Summary**
In this example:
- We used **compound joins** to match data across multiple tables (`Shipments`, `TransportDetails`, `AuditRecords`, `CustomerOrders`).
- The results give a **comprehensive view** of the shipments, transport, audits, and customer orders in a single query.
- Real-life examples like this are often seen in logistics, e-commerce, supply chain management, and other domains requiring complex data joins.
